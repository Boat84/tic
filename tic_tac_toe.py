# In this script you can write your code.
# Start by writing all the functions.
# In the last part after if __name__ == "__main__": you can call the functions to play your game.
# If you run `python tic_tac_toe.py` in the command line the game will start. Try it out! ;)

# Function for ... (displaying the board?)
def blabla():
    pass


# Function for... (choosing a player?)
def blablabla():
    pass


# ... write as many functions as you need


# Tic-tac-toe game
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Start a new round of Tic-tac-toe
    print("Welcome to a new round of Tic-Tac-Toe!")
